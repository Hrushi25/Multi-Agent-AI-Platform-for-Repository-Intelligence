# CodeChat Lite

**CodeChat Lite** is a lightweight, open-source demonstration of the **core architecture and agent workflows** behind **CodeChat** — a full-scale, production-grade AI platform I built while working at **DreamStudio (non-profit)**.

This repository intentionally focuses on a **simplified subset** of the system to make the design easy to understand, run locally, and discuss in interviews.  
The README also documents the **complete capabilities of the original CodeChat platform** to provide full architectural context.

## 🚀 The Full CodeChat Platform (DreamStudio)

While at DreamStudio, I built **CodeChat**, a comprehensive, enterprise-ready AI platform with the following capabilities:

---

## 🧠 AI & Agent Architecture

- **Multi-agent architecture** with specialized agents for:
  - Conversational chat
  - Document ingestion and indexing
  - Code understanding and execution
  - Diagram generation
  - GitHub repository analysis
- Dynamic agent routing and orchestration
- Tool-augmented LLM workflows
- Prompt governance and agent isolation

---

## 📄 Multimodal Knowledge Ingestion

Upload and analyze:
- PDFs, text files, markdown, and code files
- GitHub repositories (entire repos, branches, PRs)

Ingestion pipeline features:
- Chunking strategies optimized for:
  - Code
  - Documentation
  - Structured and unstructured text
- Semantic embeddings and vector-based retrieval

---

## 🔍 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

- High-precision semantic search
- Context assembly across multiple documents
- Strict grounding of LLM responses in retrieved context
- Hallucination-resistant answer generation
- Configurable retrieval depth and relevance scoring

---

## 🧑‍💻 GitHub MCP & Developer Intelligence

- GitHub repository ingestion
- File-level and repo-level semantic search
- Code-aware retrieval and explanation
- Architecture and dependency analysis
- Support for developer workflows and code navigation

---

## 🏢 Enterprise & Platform Capabilities

- Authentication and role-based access control (RBAC)
- Usage tracking and rate limiting
- Billing and quota enforcement
- Admin dashboards and analytics
- Audit logging and activity tracking
- Secure API key management
- Environment-based configuration (dev / staging / prod)

---

## 📊 Observability & Operations

- Usage metrics and analytics
- Error tracking and structured logging
- Agent-level performance monitoring
- System health dashboards
- Production deployment workflows

---

## 🌐 User Experience

- Rich chat-based UI
- Multi-session conversation history
- Document and repository management
- Admin interfaces for monitoring and control
- Scalable, production-ready frontend architecture

---

## 🧩 What This Repository Demonstrates (CodeChat Lite)

This repository is a **distilled demo** that focuses on the **core technical ideas** behind the full CodeChat platform:

- 📄 File upload and ingestion  
- 🔍 Semantic embeddings using `sentence-transformers`  
- 🧠 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)  
- 🤖 Context-grounded answers using Gemini  
- 🗂️ Lightweight GitHub repository ingestion (MCP-lite)  
- 💬 ChatGPT-style UI built with React  
- ❌ Explicit handling of no-context scenarios (no hallucination when context is missing)
